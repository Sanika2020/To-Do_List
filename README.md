## Problem Statement:
To build a to do list app where tasks are stored on the blockchain and  each task is associated with a token and users can earn rewards in crypto.

## Solution:
-Many existing to-do list apps lack innovation: Users often need more motivation to complete tasks.
-Traditional task management systems do not utilize the potential of blockchain technology.

## Goal: 
To create a decentralized to-do list app where tasks are stored on the blockchain, and users are rewarded with Diam tokens. 

## Unique Features for better User Experience (UX):
-Monetary Rewards: Earn cryptocurrency for completing tasks
-Enhanced Motivation: Financial incentives to boost productivity.
-Ownership: Users have control over their tasks and rewards.
-Trust and Security: Immutable records ensure fair reward distribution.

## WorkFlow of the Web-App:
Step 1: User creates a task in the app.
Step 2: The task is stored on the blockchain and a token is issued.
Step 3: User completes the task and marks it as done.
Step 4: Smart contract verifies completion and releases the reward.
Step 5: User receives cryptocurrency in their wallet. 

## Technologies Used:
